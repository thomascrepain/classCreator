# classCreator

Generates classes for every table in a database. 

The classes are generated from a [smarty template](http://www.smarty.net/).

## Installation

1. Copy the `settings.php.inc` file to `settings.php` and fill in your options accordingly.
2. Add your templates to the template directory which you've just configured.
3. Make sure the permissions are set correctly on the `classCreator` folder. If you're not sure, run the following in the commandline:

    chmod -R a+rw
